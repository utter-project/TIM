### Main objectives

#### Objective 1 - Advancing research in responsible creation and application of multilingual, multi- modal pretrained XR models

Advance the state-of-the-art in multimodal, multilingual pre-trained models and their appli- cation to downstream tasks. This project will focus on making them customizable, efficient, and ethical.

**Challenge:** Push forward the science of extremely large pre-trained models, make them energy efficient.

**Success indicators:** High-impact publications in machine learning field, widespread adoption of our provided models by the community.

**Milestones:** MS10, MS18.

#### Objective 2 - Development of new methods and algorithms for adapted, contextualised, and ro- bust dialogue assistant XR models

Leverage multimodal models to deliver tools which provide a new paradigm in quality, ro- bustness, and contextualisation capabilities for dialogue assistant components such as tran- scription, translation, and summarisation.

**Challenge:** Increase the quality and coverage of dialogue assistant technologies

**Success indicators:** High quality speech and text components which work across 6 languages


**Milestones:** MS3, MS11, MS21


#### Objective 3 - Development of tools for online meetings and customer support agents

Design and implementation of interfaces to visualise, edit and publish transcripts, minutes, combined with meeting platforms like Zoom to deliver multilingual transcription and trans- lation support.

**Challenge:** Integration and testing of platform and interfaces

**Success indicators:** Successful evaluation of project technologies by user partners and user group


**Milestones:** MS8, MS19, MS24


#### Objective 4 - Sustainable, maintainable platform and services

Development of a plan for sustainable exploitation and use of the platforms, systems and technologies developed in UTTER.

**Challenge:** Adoption of a multimodal, multilingual dialogue assistant platform by individuals and industry

**Success indicators:** Agreed sustainability plan for UTTER platform

**Milestones:** MS26


#### Objective 5 - Dissemination and communication of project results to stakeholders

Dissemination and communication of project results to stakeholders and user group. Suc- cessful promotion and use of platform in the pilots run under the financial support to third parties call.

**Challenge:** Dissemination and communication plan focused on key online meeting providers and the customer support market

**Success indicators:** UTTER workshops, dissemination at customer care trade shows, open-source software, datasets, and models.
 
**Milestones:**  MS13, MS23
